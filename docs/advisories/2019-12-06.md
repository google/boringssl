# OpenSSL Advisory: December 6th, 2019 (BoringSSL Not Affected)

OpenSSL have published a [security advisory](https://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20191206.txt). Here's how it affects BoringSSL:

CVE | Summary | [Severity] in OpenSSL | Impact to BoringSSL
----|---------|-----------------------|---------------------
CVE-2019-1551 | rsaz_512_sqr overflow bug on x86_64 | Low | Not affected, impacted code was removed from BoringSSL in 2016

[Severity]: https://openssl-library.org/policies/general/security-policy/index.html#issue-severity

## CVE-2019-1551

There was an overflow bug in OpenSSL’s x86_64 optimizations. This affected modular exponentiation with 512-bit moduli and secret exponent, most commonly used by 1024-bit RSA. OpenSSL’s advisory additionally lists 3-prime RSA1536, DSA1024, and DH512. (We suspect that the listing of DSA1024 rather than DSA512 might be a mistake.)

BoringSSL is not affected by this bug, having removed the relevant code at the [end of 2016](https://boringssl-review.googlesource.com/c/boringssl/+/12841).
